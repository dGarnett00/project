  My project is just a website that features 3 pages.
  one of the pages i created is an game page that includes
  a memory pick and match card game.
    the 3 features i chose are 
  1.A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

  2.Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. 

3. Allow the user to rearrange or move items by clicking and dragging an element on your site

 Additional features i chose to implement into the project are

 4. Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page
