# My project is just a website that features 3 pages.
# one of the pages i created is an game page that includes
# a memory pick and match card game.
# the 3 feaures i chose are 
 # 1.A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

 # 2.Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own

# 3. Allow the user to rearrange or move items by clicking and dragging an element on your site
